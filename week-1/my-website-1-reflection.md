Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository on github is extremely simple. On the github mainpage, click the green button that says,  "new repository". Name your repository, make it public or private depending on its use, and add a license as necessary. Click create repository and you are done. To clone your repository, open up your "repo" and copy the URL in the bottom right corner. Open up the terminal and navigate to the place you want to clone your repo utilizing the "cd" command. Once you are in the right directory, type: "git clone URL" - replacing URL with the copied URL.

Describe what open source means.
Open source simply means that the code behind a program is open to the public. This allows for collaboration and customization. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Overall I believe open source is beneficial. It promotes sharing and community driven programming. Debugging must also be better with more sets of eyes going through the source code. The only time it makes me feel nervous is reguarding security and confidentiality issues.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
The use of licenses is very beneficial for open source projects because it defines the role between the creators and the contributors by defining their rights. These licenses not only protect the developers but also add a level of protection for its end-users as well.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
