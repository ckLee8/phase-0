# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I briefly researched most of the productivity techniques, but the ones that really intrigued me were tiny habits, timebox, and achieving flow. In my mind all three are interconnected because tiny habits and timebox are merely a means of achieving flow. Tiny habits are the incremental and achievable steps that result in success, while timebox is the container in which you complete those steps. The two in conjunction allows for an efficient use of time and a clear singular goal, which are the main ingredients for entering the flow. Timebox will be particularly useful for coding because you have a set time period to complete a task, regardless of the end result. At the end of that time, it will be immensely helpful to take a step back and assess what was completed, what wasn’t completed, and why the end result is as it is.

The productivity techniques differ greatly from the ones I am using. I am approaching my time from a macro position, overall tasks and scheduling. This can be useful for forecasting the day and staying on track in the long-term. The techniques presented are more about time efficiency than management and focus on the micro aspect of productivity. As it stand, I am currently neglecting the micro aspects of time management, but I believe both micro and macro are necessary for success. I will try implementing the three techniques above slowly to see any noticeable improvements. First to my assignments then perhaps to other areas of my life. My overall approach to phase 0 will be that of adaptability. I don’t know how the various challenges and people I will encounter will affect the time I spend, so I am keeping an open mind.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

>>>>>>> master
The shell is a command line interface, a program that enables a user to directly access data on the computer via text without having to utilize a visual interface. It enables the user to be efficient and not be restrained by the confines of the visual interface. Bash is a variant of shell and is short for Bourne again Shell.

For me, the most difficult part of learning to use the command line is the raw memorization of all the commands in such a short period of time. I was going through all the tutorials and didn’t have any problems with going through each of the commands. The most important of these commands in my opinion are ls, cd, mv, find, and grep.

<<<<<<< HEAD
-pwd : prints the working directory 
-ls : lists the directory 
-mv : move file 
-cd : change directory 
-../ : *don't remember this one 
-touch : creates an empty file 
-mkdir : make directory 
-less : page through a file 
-rmdir : remove directory 
-rm : remove file or directory 
-help : displays a help page

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

>>>>>>> master
In order to create a new repo, you must navigate to the github main page and click the green button, new repository. Name your repository, decide whether you want a public or private repo, and add any licenses necessary.

Forking a repo is very simple. Go to the github repository you wish to copy and click fork in the top right hand corner. Click it and save it your profile by selecting the correct account.

Cloning a repo may be the most difficult for a new user, but listen closely. First go to the repo, which you wish to clone. Copy the link in the bottom right of the page, titled HTTPS clone url. Open your terminal. Using the change directory command (cd), navigate to the folder, which you wish to clone the repo to. After you have properly navigated to the clone location, type: “git clone “ followed by the url copied.

The most difficult part of this challenge for me was navigating smoothly to the clone destination folder via terminal. What I learned is that practice is vital for making these sort of operations smooth and natural, opposed to just following instructions.
