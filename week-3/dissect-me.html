  	<h2>version control</h2>
    <p>
      The most obvious, but perhaps the most powerful benefit of utilizing version control is that it can track change in developers' code. Developers need to track their progress to see where they are going and how they are going to get there. Part of that is enabled by version control because it allows for the user to properly store various versions of their code. This functionality is imperative in the event developers need to fix bugs or rollback an update. Another benefit of version control is that it promotes collaboration and sharing within a community. With the rise of what some are coining "social coding," version control's importance is higher than ever. The two supplement and compliment each other by providing rapid developing, but with the safeguard of checks and balances.

        Git, a variant of version control, has been indispensable for tracking change. The ability to create branches that do not affect the master branch allows for experimenting and quick iterations. Any time I need to commit to code, git allows me to document and seemlessly merge the experimental branch with the master branch. The terminal command: "git log" is truly vital for keeping track of change. All alterations are dated and timestamped for convenience.

        Github, the online repository, makes for a great cloud-based solution for coders who need to implement version control. Because the code is stored on the internet, it encourages collaboration and sharing. Github is a public domain that also enables licenses, which is key for open source projects. Github is also a great place to store your code because you might not always be on your computer or your hardware may fail. The cloud enables you to access that code from virtually anywhere and anytime.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
The html5 tags we utilized were mostly the basics <html>, <head>, <title>, <meta>, <body>, <section>, <h2>, <p>. These are the basic skeletal structure of an html webpage, as such we utilized them.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements are read top down. There are nodes and nodes within nodes in html to determine the semantic heirarchy.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Sublime is definitely a powerful text editor. We researched how to make snippets and I can see it being immensely useful for switching between different programming languages. -->
