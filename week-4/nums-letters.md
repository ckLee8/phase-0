puts is a ruby command that returns a value of nil and prints the value of evaluated code to console.

Simply put, integers are a type of numerical data that represent numbers without a decimal. Floats are numerical data that represent numbers with decimals.

Integer division always rounds down to nearest integer. Float division is more accurate and produces an answer as closely as possible. It has a precision of 24 bits which equates to about 7 digits.

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby is fairly simple in regards to basic arithmatic. Depending on the use of variables or puts the code is evaluated and assigned or outputted.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are simply characters that can include digits and letters.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables only available on a specific level. Sometimes you want a variable local to a certain method, but not accessible to another method.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
It was a decent review, but a tad bit repetitive and segemented.
