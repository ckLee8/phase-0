What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a visual blueprint of the information heirarchy. The basic design elements are mapped out and positioned accordingly as to give the developer an idea of what he or she is building.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing is but another step in design and UX. It is a little more visual than the site-map and takes into account visual positioning.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, I enjoyed creating a wireframe because it gets me excited for a finshed product.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I pretty much had an idea of my site before this, so I stuck with my first idea.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I used the links and resources provided. Those proved to be immensely useful. My main question was which wireframe tool should I use?

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
Again, I feel as though, using git and github can be a little redundant, but on a positive note, I have those down pat.
